In order to properly understand the success or failure of an email marketing campaign, it is
necessary to monitor several key metrics. The insights gained from these metrics can then be used to
optimize future campaigns.

Key metrics
===========

Opened rate
-----------

The *opened rate* measures the number of emails that were opened by recipients again the total
number that were delivered. A high open rate can indicate the subject line was compelling,
and was successful in enticing recipients to engage with content.

Reply rate
----------

The *replied rate* measures the number of recipients who responded to the messages directly. This
metric provides insight into the level of engagement and interaction with the email content. A high
reply rate can indicate that the email resonated with recipients, prompting them to take action, or
provide feedback.

Click through rate
------------------

*Click through rate*, |CTR|, measures the percentage of recipients who clicked on one or more links
within the email. A higher |CTR| suggests that the email content is relative, and appropriately
targeted to the recipient. It can also indicate the strength of any calls to action that were
included in the message.

Received rate and Bounced rate
------------------------------

*Received rate* and *Bounced rate* both measure the number of messages that were successfully
delivered against the number that were sent in total. *Received rate* measures the number delivered
successfully, while *bounced rate* measures the number that were unsuccessful. These metrics are
measures of the integrity of an email list, and can be used to identify quality issues.
