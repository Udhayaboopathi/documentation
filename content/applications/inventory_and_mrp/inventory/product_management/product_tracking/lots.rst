*Lots* are one of the two ways to identify and track products in Odoo. They typically represent a
specific batch of products that were received, stored, shipped, or manufactured in-house.

Manufacturers assign lot numbers to groups of products sharing common properties, facilitating
end-to-end traceability through their lifecycles.

Lots are useful for managing large quantities of manufactured or received products, aiding in
tracing items back to their group, particularly for product recalls or :doc:`expiration dates
<expiration_dates>`.

   :doc:`serial_numbers`

Configuration
=============

To track products by lots, enable the *Lots & Serial Numbers* feature. Then, configure each product
to be tracked by serial numbers on the product form.

Enable lots & serial numbers
----------------------------

To track products using lots, enable the *Lots & Serial Numbers* feature. Go to the
:menuselection:`Inventory app --> Configuration --> Settings`, scroll down to the
:guilabel:`Traceability` section, and tick the checkbox next to :guilabel:`Lots & Serial Numbers`.
Then, click :guilabel:`Save`.

Track by lots
-------------

Once :guilabel:`Lots & Serial Numbers` is activated, configure individual products to be tracked
using lots. To do this, go to :menuselection:`Inventory app --> Products --> Products`, and choose a
product.

On the product form, go to the :guilabel:`Inventory` tab. In the :guilabel:`Traceability` section,
enable :guilabel:`Tracking` :guilabel:`By Lots`. Now, new or existing lot numbers can be assigned to
newly-received or manufactured batches of this product.

.. important::
   If a product has stock on-hand prior to activating tracking by lots or serial numbers, use an
   inventory adjustment to assign lot numbers to existing products in stock.

.. image:: lots/tracking-product-form.png

   :alt: Enabled tracking by lots feature on product form.

Assign lots for shipping and receiving
======================================

Assign new lot numbers to :ref:`incoming goods <inventory/product_management/assign-lots>` on the
receipt form. When shipping :ref:`outgoing goods
<inventory/product_management/assign-lots-delivery>`, select products with specific lot numbers on
the delivery order form.

.. _inventory/product_management/assign-lots:

On receipts
-----------

Assigning new or existing lot numbers to incoming goods can be done directly on receipts.

To begin, go to the :menuselection:`Purchase` app to create and confirm a |PO| for products tracked
by lot numbers. Then, click the :guilabel:`Receipt` smart button that appears at the top of the
page to navigate to the warehouse receipt form.

.. note::
   Alternatively, navigate to an existing receipt by going to the :menuselection:`Inventory` app,
   clicking the :guilabel:`Receipts` Kanban card, and choosing the desired receipt.

.. important::
   Clicking :guilabel:`Validate` before assigning a lot number triggers a :guilabel:`User Error`,
   indicating that a lot number **must** be assigned before validating the receipt.

   .. image:: lots/user-error.png
      :align: center
      :alt: Add lot/serial number user error popup.

On the receipt form, select the :guilabel:`⦙≣ (bulleted list)` icon to the right of the product that
is tracked by lot numbers.

.. figure:: lots/bulleted-list-icon.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Show the bulleted list icon on the product line.

   The bulleted list icon on the product line.

Doing so opens the :guilabel:`Detailed Operations` pop-up window, where the :guilabel:`Lot/Serial
Number` and :guilabel:`Done` quantity are assigned.

The two ways to assign lot numbers are **manually** and **copy/paste**.

Manual assignment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To manually assign lot numbers, click :guilabel:`Add a line` and choose the location the products
will be stored in under the :guilabel:`To` column. Then, type a new :guilabel:`Lot/Serial Number`
and specify the :guilabel:`Done` quantity.

.. note::
   To assign multiple lot numbers or store to multiple locations, click :guilabel:`Add a line` and
   type a new :guilabel:`Lot/Serial Number` for additional quantities. Repeat until the total in the
   :guilabel:`Done` column matches the :guilabel:`Quantity Done` at the top.

.. image:: lots/assign-lot-number-popup.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Assign lot number detailed operations popup.

Copy and paste
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

From a spreadsheet with all of the lot numbers received from the supplier (or manually chosen to
assign upon receipt), copy and paste the lot numbers, in the :guilabel:`Lot/Serial Number` column.

.. image:: lots/lots-excel-spreadsheet.png
   :align: center
   :alt: List of lot numbers copied on excel spreadsheet.

.. figure:: lots/bulk-sn.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Lot numbers copied to the lot number line.

   Lot numbers copied to the lot number line, with each lot number on its own line.

After clicking away from the text field, Odoo automatically generates the necessary lot number
lines. The quantities in the :guilabel:`Done` column match the first entry. Manually adjust the
:guilabel:`To` locations and :guilabel:`Done` quantities for each lot number, as needed.

Once all product quantities have been assigned a lot number, click :guilabel:`Confirm` to close the
pop-up. Then, click :guilabel:`Validate` on the receipt form.

.. seealso::
   :ref:`Traceability report for lot numbers <inventory/product_management/lot-traceability>`

.. _inventory/product_management/assign-lots-delivery:

On delivery orders
------------------

Specify which lot numbers for a product are chosen for outgoing shipment on the delivery order form.

To begin, create or select an existing |SO| from the :menuselection:`Sales` app. After confirming
the |SO|, the :guilabel:`Delivery` smart button becomes available. Click the :guilabel:`Delivery`
smart button to view the warehouse receipt form for that specific |SO|.

.. note::
   Alternatively, navigate to delivery orders by going to the :menuselection:`Inventory` app and
   clicking the :guilabel:`Delivery Orders` Kanban card.

On the delivery order form, in the :guilabel:`Detailed Operations` tab, click the :guilabel:`⦙≣
(bulleted list)` icon to the right of the product that is tracked by lot numbers. Clicking that icon
reveals a :guilabel:`Detailed Operations` pop-up window.

In the :guilabel:`Detailed Operations` pop-up window, a :guilabel:`Lot/Serial Number` is chosen,
with the full :guilabel:`Reserved` quantity taken from that specific lot (if there is enough stock
in that particular lot).

If there is insufficient stock in that lot, or if partial quantities of the :guilabel:`Demand`
should be taken from multiple lots, change the quantity in the :guilabel:`Done` column to only
include that specific part of the total quantity.

.. note::
   The lot automatically chosen for delivery orders varies, depending on the selected removal
   strategy (:abbr:`FIFO (First In, First Out)`, :abbr:`LIFO (Last In, First Out)`, or :abbr:`FEFO
   (First Expiry, First Out)`). It also depends on the ordered quantity, and whether the lot's
   on-hand quantity is enough to fulfill the order.

.. seealso::
   :doc:`../../warehouses_storage/advanced_operations_warehouse/removal`

Next, click :guilabel:`Add a line`, select a different :guilabel:`Lot/Serial Number`, apply the
remaining :guilabel:`Done` quantities, and click :guilabel:`Confirm` to close the pop-up window.
Lastly, click the :guilabel:`Validate` button to deliver the products.

Lot management
==============

Manage and view existing lot numbers for products in the :guilabel:`Lot/Serial Numbers` dashboard by
going to :menuselection:`Inventory app --> Products --> Lots/Serial Numbers`.

By default, lot numbers are grouped by product, and selecting the drop-down menu for each product
displays the existing lot numbers. Select a lot number to :ref:`modify or add details
<inventory/product_management/edit-lot>` linked to the lot. Lot numbers can also be :ref:`created
<inventory/product_management/create-new-lot>` from this page.

.. figure:: lots/lot-dashboard.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Show the "Lot/Serial Number" dashboard.

   Display lot numbers, grouped by products, on the **Lot/Serial Number** dashboard.

.. _inventory/product_management/edit-lot:

Modify lot
----------

Clicking a lot from the :guilabel:`Lot/Serial Number` dashboard reveals a separate page where
additional information can be provided about the lot.

.. tip::
   Odoo automatically generates a new :guilabel:`Lot/Serial Number` to follow the most recent
   number. However, it can be edited, by clicking the line under the :guilabel:`Lot/Serial Number`
   field, and changing the generated number to any desired one.

On the lot number form, the following fields can be modified:

- :guilabel:`Lot/Serial Number`: Change the lot number linked to the :guilabel:`Product`
- :guilabel:`Internal Reference`: Records an alternative lot/serial number used within the warehouse
  that differs from the supplier manufacturer's.
- :guilabel:`Company`: Specify the company where the lot number is available.
- :guilabel:`Description`: Add extra details about the lot or serial number in this text field.

.. important::
   The :guilabel:`Product` and :guilabel:`Quantity` fields **cannot** be modified, as the lot
   numbers are linked with existing stock moves.

.. image:: lots/lot-number.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Show the lot number form.

.. seealso::
   :doc:`Set expiration dates for lots <expiration_dates>`

When all desired configurations are complete, click the :guilabel:`Save` button to save all changes.

.. _inventory/product_management/create-new-lot:

Reserve lot number for a product
--------------------------------

To create a lot number for a product, begin by going to :menuselection:`Inventory app --> Products
--> Lot/Serial Numbers`, and click :guilabel:`New`.

.. important::
   Creating a lot number reserves it for a product but **does not** assign it. To assign lot
   numbers, refer to the section on :ref:`assigning lot numbers on receipts
   <inventory/product_management/assign-lots>`.

.. tip::
   While Odoo automatically generates a new :guilabel:`Lot/Serial Number` to follow the most recent
   number, it can be edited and changed to any desired number, by clicking the line under the
   :guilabel:`Lot/Serial Number` field, and changing the generated number.

Once the new :guilabel:`Lot/Serial Number` is generated, click the blank field next to
:guilabel:`Product` to reveal a drop-down menu. From this menu, select the product to which this new
number will be assigned.

.. example::
   The lot number, `0000011`, is created for the product, `Drawer Black`.

   .. image:: lots/new-lot-number.png
      :align: center
      :alt: New lot number creation form with assigned product.

After a new lot number has been created, saved, and assigned to the desired product, the lot number
is saved as an existing lot number linked to the product, and can be selected when :ref:`assigning
lot numbers to products on a receipt <inventory/product_management/assign-lots>` or when making an
inventory adjustment.

.. example::
   After creating the lot number, `0000011` appears as an option for `Drawer Black` when assigning
   lot numbers on the :guilabel:`Inventory Adjustment` page.

   .. image:: lots/inventory-adjustment.png
      :align: center
      :alt: Show how to assign serial numbers on the Inventory Adjustment page.

Manage lots for different operations types
==========================================

By default, new lots can only be created when receiving products, and existing lot numbers cannot
be used. For sales orders, only existing lot numbers can be utilized, and new ones cannot be created
on the delivery order.

To change the ability to use new (or existing) lot numbers on any operation type, go to the
:menuselection:`Inventory app --> Configuration --> Operations Types`, and select the desired
operation type.

On the operation type form, under the :guilabel:`Lots/Serial Numbers` section, tick the
:guilabel:`Create New` checkbox to enable new lot numbers to be created during this operation type.
Choose :guilabel:`Use Existing ones` if only existing lot numbers can be selected.

.. image:: lots/operations-type-form.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Enabled traceability setting on operations type form.

.. tip::
   For inter-warehouse transfers involving products tracked by lots, it can be useful to enable the
   :guilabel:`Use Existing Lots/Serial Numbers` option for warehouse receipts.

.. _inventory/product_management/lot-traceability:

Traceability
============

Manufacturers and companies can refer to traceability reports to see the entire lifecycle of a
product: where (and when) it came from, where it was stored, and who (and when) it went to.

To see the full traceability of a product, or group by lots, go to the :menuselection:`Inventory app
--> Products --> Lots/Serial Numbers`. Doing so reveals the :menuselection:`Lots/Serial Numbers`
dashboard.

From here, products with lot numbers assigned to them will be listed by default, and can be expanded
to show the lot numbers those products have assigned to them.

To group by lots, begin by removing any filters in the search bar. Then, click the :guilabel:`Group
By` drop-down, select :guilabel:`Add Custom Group`, and select :guilabel:`Lot/Serial Number` from
the drop-down menu. Then, click :guilabel:`Apply`.

Doing so displays all existing lots and serial numbers, and can be expanded to show all quantities
of products with that assigned number.

Traceability report
-------------------

To view a full stock moves report for a lot number, select the lot number line from the
:guilabel:`Lots/Serial Number` dashboard. On the lot number form, click the :guilabel:`Traceability
Report` smart button.
